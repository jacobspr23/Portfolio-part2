           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">When creating these three projects, I really wanted to focus on learning more about structure and interactivity using css. In my previous experience in web development, my primary focus was on javascript and functionality rather than the design, layout, and different ways I can play with the UI using css. In my Webtext Experiment project, I did this by learning more about the paralax scrolling affect and how to use the linear gradent to change the background color in the css. I also played around with different interactive elements using javascript to change the background color based on the users choice, and changing the size of buttons. In my Branching, non-linear website, I spent a lot of time playing around with how I wanted to structure a game-like website. I used AI to write the story itself because I wanted to be able to spend more time thinking about how I could make the background more interesting, and make the website itself more engaging. I think I could have done better with adding more interactive elements to it, but I like how the structure of the project was laid out.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">When it comes to engaging with others in the workshop environment, I like being able to see others' ideas and how they went about creating their project and what their thought process was in making it. I enjoy helping out with problems others may have or just explaining how I went about creating my own project as well. I am usually pretty good at working through and figuring out how to solve my own problems, but I like being able to help others if they face similar problems that I did.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Thinking about my craft with my previous projects, I believe that I put in a satisfactory amount of time and effort into each of the projects. I think I would have been able to do better if I had more time to focus on finding new innovative ways to introduce interactive elements into my projects, especially my third one. On top of assignments I have for my other classes, I dedicate a large chunk of time to making something that I am proud of. I can always think of ways to improve my craft, as it is nowhere near perfect, but learning more about how I can apply new elements into my projects will help me grow in my craft. I want my craft to show an immense attention to detail, and find a way to engage the user to provide an enjoyable experience.</p>

        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">When making these projects, I did a lot of research and developing my skills with creating online media. In the second project, I did a lot of reading about paralax scrolling, and tried to implement different speeds in the scrolling using javascript, but I ended up spending too much time on it and not being able to get it to work. That's when I decided to figure out more about how the basic paralax scrolling effect was able to work. Another thing that I learned with this project is the ability to have user input from different input boxes manipulate the webpage. I found out how to use a slider input to change the size of buttons, and how to use a color picker to change the background color of the page. An unforseen skill that I learned about when creating the third project is prompt engineering when using an AI model to create something. I did a lot of research finding out how to curate a perfect prompt to get the ideal response that I want from an AI model. It took a lot of trial and error, along with youtube videos to build a storyline for a choose your own adventure story, and prompting it to create relevant images and gifs that go along with the story. I think that though this is not a part of html and css, it is imporant to learn how to properly and efficiently use new tools in technology to assist in many different aspects. Aside from that, I learned a lot more about structuring the page. I was not sure how I wanted to go about it at first due to there being a lot of writing, but I used the text block structure to have the text in the middle of the page with a black background and an image sitting behind it by manipulating the body in the css. I also used the grid system and button templates together to put the choices grouped together in one centered row.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">When it comes to the packaging of my work, I think I could have done a better job on my second project to make it more clear what the purpose for each of the elements was. I pretty much just relied on the user to scroll down to the bottom and click an arrow, then play around with the items on the next page. I think that I fixed that with my third project, as I believe that the UX/UI of the project was crafted well. I focused on making a clear and simple layout with elements like buttons that changed color, and text that was easy to read. I also used the grid system to make the layout of the project more organized. I think that having a start page that introduces the user to the point of the project, and having clear goals for what they are supposed to do on the website is important. I think that my main goal for this project was to focus heavily on usability and having clear distinctions for what the user was supposed to interact with. I think that the story that accompanies this project is also very interesting and engaging as well, as it provides plot twists and excitement to the user, and allows them to work to their own outcome, and try again as many times as they would like.</p>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">When it came to creating these projects, I did my best to learn how to use new features of various programs and learn how to use them effectively. I would watch youtube videos to learn how to use these new features, and would work to incorporate these new things into my projects. This is how I created the glitch effect in the special effects project. I also looked up some tips for using adobe lightroom and after effects, as I had minimal experience with these previously.</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">I worked well engaging with others in a workshop environment. I was able to get some tips for how to make my projects more visually appealing, and also did my best to give advice to others and provide them with constructive feedback. I would make sure to actively participate in groups every week, only missing one class when I was sick.</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">When I think about my craft, I like to think about the new programs and features that I was learning how to use for some of the different projects. I put an emphasis on wanting to learn how to use something new rather than just doing something that I knew how to already. This meant diving into youtube videos for how to properly use some transitions and effects in various programs like after effects and premiere.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">This goes along with what I said about my craft. I would watch the videos provided to learn how to use different features and keep my mind open to learning new things. I did a lot of teaching myself how to use lightroom, and also how to combine different effects in after effects and premiere to create something new.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">When making my work, I liked to give attention to detail in how it is presented and looks. I made sure to typically have some kind of background music like in my photo essay and broll project. I also put a lot of effort into making my work look visually appealing by putting in smooth transitions and messing with keyframes to make everything move seamlessly.</p>
